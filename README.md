# Simple Banking System

In this project, I programmed a simple banking system which generates toy bank card numbers along with PINs. It stores them in a relational database along with information about the cardholder's account balance. I implemented Luhn's algorithm to generate and validate checksums for the toy bank card numbers. I also used the SQLite database engine to build and query the database.

I know this program could be much more elegantly structured. The project's scope changed at different stages which required me to refactor on the fly. I needed to finish in order to stay on track, so I decided to publish the minimum workable version. I'll refactor it further when I have time. 

This is the 7th project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track. 

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/109?track=2):

"Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database."

Topics covered include:
- SQL, SQLite module & relational databases
- Luhn's algorithm
- OOP
